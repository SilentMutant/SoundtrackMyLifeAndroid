# SoundTrack My Life
## Background
This app was created as a final project for my Android Development class at the Khoury College of Computer Science while going for my Masters. It was done independently.
## Concept
The idea of this app is to be able to mark different locations on a map of your home town. Then you can make different playlists and set them to those locations. When you enter those locations that playlist will play, just like a soundtrack.
